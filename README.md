World War of Ants
•	Eciton (army ant)
	o	200 different species
	o	Living nest with millions of ants
	o	While on a hunt, some for lines up to 100 meters long
	o	Killing & dismembering every insect or small vertebra they encounter 
	o	The biggest hunting parties can kill up to 500K animals per day
	
•	Neotropical Army Ants specialize in hunting and consuming insects, especially:
	o	Termites
	o	Wasps
	o	Ants
	
•	Wasps
	o	bigger and stronger than individual ants, will kill a few, but quickly overwhelmed 
	o	If queen survives, army ants steals larvae and quickly devour, no recovery 
	
•	Army ants
	o	When they discover another colony, they immediately attack
	o	Act as a social unit, they are especially dangerous and effective
	o	Overwhelm with numbers before victim colony can mount effective defense
	o	army ants don’t fight army ants, if encountered, they ignore and move away
	
•	Types of army ants
	o	Army and soldier
	o	Bullet ant
	o	Giant Amazonian ant
	
•	Pheidole desertorum defense:
	o	Immediately evacuate nest when they notice army ants
	o	Carry as many larvae as they can in order to return and rebuild after attack
	
•	Pheidole obtusospinosa defense:
	o	Worker classes have big square heads
	o	Used to block entrances to nest when army ants show up
	o	Attackers give up after a while
	
•	Leaf cutter ants (Atta cephalotes)
	o	largest and most complex societies 
	o	Nests are several meters deep and harbor millions with a division of labor
	o	Compartments consist of:
			Refuse
			Brood chambers
			Fungus gardens
	o	Soldiers are 100x larger than workers, sole purpose to defend against army ants
	o	Nemesis is Nomamyrmex esenbeckii 
	
•	Nomamyrmex Esenbeckii
	o	Diet consist of larvae of other ants
	o	Compared to other army ants, they have a more robust soldier class
	o	Short, bulky appendages
	o	Heavy armor
	o	Only species that can successfully attack a mature colony of leaf cutters
	o	When they find a leaf cutter colony, hundreds of thousands attack in a long column
	o	Attackers swarm leaf cutters and try to sting to death in a mob
	o	Still superior in numbers
	o	If leaf cutters do not repel army ants or barricade entrances, army ants swarm and overrun everything, steal larvae
	
•	Leaf cutter defense:
	o	Enter crisis mode
	o	Soldiers swarm to site of attack
	o	“Front line” develops, up to a few meters wide and one meter deep with ants
	o	Soldiers go head-to-head, try to cut off heads
	o	Smaller leaf cutter workers try to help by ripping legs of enemies
	o	Workers create barricades to seal off as many entrances as possible to secure
	
Types of battles
	•	Skirmishes
		o	Smaller, quicker battles
	•	Raids
		o	Larger, longer, and more complex battles
	•	Invasions
		o	Full-out invasions, and take-overs of other colonies
